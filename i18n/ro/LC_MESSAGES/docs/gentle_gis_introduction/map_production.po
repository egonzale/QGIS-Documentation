"Map production is the process of arranging map elements on a sheet of paper "
"in a way that, even without many words, the average person can understand "
"what it is all about. Maps are usually produced for presentations and "
"reports where the audience or reader is a politician, citizen or a learner "
"with no professional background in GIS. Because of this, a map has to be "
"effective in communicating spatial information. Common elements of a map are"
" the title, map body, legend, north arrow, scale bar, acknowledgement, and "
"map border (see figure_map_elements_)."
msgstr "Producția cartografică este procesul de aranjare în pagină a elementelor hărții  într-o asemenea manieră încît, chiar cu puține cuvinte, o persoană medie poate înțelege despre ce e vorba. Hărțile sînt produse, de regulă, pentru prezentări și rapoarte, a căror audiență sau grup de cititori sînt compuse din politicieni, cetățeni sau persoane care învață, fără o formație profesională în domeniul GIS. Din acest motiv, o hartă trebuie să comunice eficient informația spațială. Elementele uzuale ale unei hărți sînt: titlul, corpul hărții, legenda, direcția nordului, scara grafică, declarația de recunoaștere și cadrul hărții (vezi figure_map_elements_)."

"Other elements that might be added are e.g. a **graticule**, or **name of "

"most important part of the map because it contains the map information. The "
"other elements support the communication process and help the map reader to "
"orientate himself and understand the map topic. For example, the title "
"describes the subject matter and the legend relates map symbols to the "
"mapped data."
msgstr "Alte elemente care pot fi adaugate sînt **caroiajul** sau **denumirea proiecției hărții** (CRS). Împreună, aceste elemente ajută cititorul să interpreteze informația afișată pe hartă.

De exemplu, titlul descrie subiectul hărții, iar legenda leagă simbolurile de pe hartă de informația cartată."

"**Expressing a scale in words** is a commonly used method and has the "
"advantage of being easily understood by most map users. You can see an "

"the **representative fraction (RF)** method, where both the map distance and"
" the ground distance in the real world are given in the same map units, as a"
" ratio. For example, a RF value 1:25,000 means that any distance on the map "
"is 1/25,000 *th* of the real distance on the ground (see figure_map_scale_ "
"(b)). The value 25,000 in the ratio is called the **scale denominator**. "

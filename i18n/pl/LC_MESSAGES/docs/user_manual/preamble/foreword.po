Staramy się bardzo udostępnić oprogramowanie GIS (które tradycyjnie jest kosztownym oprogramowaniem prawnie zastrzeżonym) wszystkim, którzy mają dostęp do komputera. Obecnie |qg| działa na większości platform uniksowych, na Windows i OS X. |qg| jest rozwijany przy użyciu C++ i narzędzi Qt (http://qt.digia.com).

#~ "A Geographical Information System (GIS) (Mitchell 2005 "
#~ ":ref:`literature_and_web`) is a collection of software that allows you to "
#~ "create, visualize, query and analyze geospatial data. Geospatial data refers"
#~ " to information about the geographic location of an entity. This often "
#~ "involves the use of a geographic coordinate, like a latitude or longitude "
#~ "value. Spatial data is another commonly used term, as are: geographic data, "
#~ "GIS data, map data, location data, coordinate data and spatial geometry "
#~ "data."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Applications using geospatial data perform a variety of functions. Map "
#~ "production is the most easily understood function of geospatial "
#~ "applications. Mapping programs take geospatial data and render it in a form "
#~ "that is viewable, usually on a computer screen or printed page. Applications"
#~ " can present static maps (a simple image) or dynamic maps that are "
#~ "customised by the person viewing the map through a desktop program or a web "
#~ "page."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Many people mistakenly assume that geospatial applications just produce "
#~ "maps, but geospatial data analysis is another primary function of geospatial"
#~ " applications. Some typical types of analysis include computing:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "distances between geographic locations"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "the amount of area (e.g., square meters) within a certain geographic region"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "what geographic features overlap other features"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "the amount of overlap between features"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "the number of locations within a certain distance of another"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "and so on..."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "These may seem simplistic, but can be applied in all sorts of ways across "
#~ "many disciplines. The results of analysis may be shown on a map, but are "
#~ "often tabulated into a report to support management decisions."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The recent phenomena of location-based services promises to introduce all "
#~ "sorts of other features, but many will be based on a combination of maps and"
#~ " analysis. For example, you have a cell phone that tracks your geographic "
#~ "location. If you have the right software, your phone can tell you what kind "
#~ "of restaurants are within walking distance. While this is a novel "
#~ "application of geospatial technology, it is essentially doing geospatial "
#~ "data analysis and listing the results for you."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Why is all this so new?"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Well, it's not. There are many new hardware devices that are enabling mobile"
#~ " geospatial services. Many open source geospatial applications are also "
#~ "available, but the existence of geospatially focused hardware and software "
#~ "is nothing new. Global positioning system (GPS) receivers are becoming "
#~ "commonplace, but have been used in various industries for more than a "
#~ "decade. Likewise, desktop mapping and analysis tools have also been a major "
#~ "commercial market, primarily focused on industries such as natural resource "
#~ "management."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "What is new is how the latest hardware and software is being applied and who"
#~ " is applying it. Traditional users of mapping and analysis tools were highly"
#~ " trained GIS Analysts or digital mapping technicians trained to use CAD-like"
#~ " tools. Now, the processing capabilities of home PCs and open source "
#~ "software (OSS) packages have enabled an army of hobbyists, professionals, "
#~ "web developers, etc. to interact with geospatial data. The learning curve "
#~ "has come down. The costs have come down. The amount of geospatial technology"
#~ " saturation has increased."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "How is geospatial data stored? In a nutshell, there are two types of "
#~ "geospatial data in widespread use today. This is in addition to traditional "
#~ "tabular data that is also widely used by geospatial applications."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Raster Data"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "One type of geospatial data is called raster data or simply \"a raster\". "
#~ "The most easily recognised form of raster data is digital satellite imagery "
#~ "or air photos. Elevation shading or digital elevation models are also "
#~ "typically represented as raster data. Any type of map feature can be "
#~ "represented as raster data, but there are limitations."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "A raster is a regular grid made up of cells, or in the case of imagery, "
#~ "pixels. They have a fixed number of rows and columns. Each cell has a "
#~ "numeric value and has a certain geographic size (e.g. 30x30 meters in size)."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Multiple overlapping rasters are used to represent images using more than "
#~ "one colour value (i.e. one raster for each set of red, green and blue values"
#~ " is combined to create a colour image). Satellite imagery also represents "
#~ "data in multiple \"bands\". Each band is essentially a separate, spatially "
#~ "overlapping raster, where each band holds values of certain wavelengths of "
#~ "light. As you can imagine, a large raster takes up more file space."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "A raster with smaller cells can provide more detail, but takes up more file "
#~ "space. The trick is finding the right balance between cell size for storage "
#~ "purposes and cell size for analytical or mapping purposes."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Vector Data"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Vector data is also used in geospatial applications. If you stayed awake "
#~ "during trigonometry and coordinate geometry classes, you will already be "
#~ "familiar with some of the qualities of vector data. In its simplest sense, "
#~ "vectors are a way of describing a location by using a set of coordinates. "
#~ "Each coordinate refers to a geographic location using a system of x and y "
#~ "values."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This can be thought of in reference to a Cartesian plane - you know, the "
#~ "diagrams from school that showed an x and y-axis. You might have used them "
#~ "to chart declining retirement savings or increasing compound mortgage "
#~ "interest, but the concepts are essential to geospatial data analysis and "
#~ "mapping."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "There are various ways of representing these geographic coordinates "
#~ "depending on your purpose. This is a whole area of study for another day - "
#~ "map projections."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Vector data takes on three forms, each progressively more complex and "
#~ "building on the former."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Points - A single coordinate (x y) represents a discrete geographic location"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Lines - Multiple coordinates (x\\ :sub:`1` y\\ :sub:`1`, x\\ :sub:`2` y\\ "
#~ ":sub:`2`, x\\ :sub:`3` y\\ :sub:`3`, ... x\\ :sub:`n` y\\ :sub:`n`) strung "
#~ "together in a certain order, like drawing a line from Point (x\\ :sub:`1` "
#~ "y\\ :sub:`1`) to Point (x\\ :sub:`2` y\\ :sub:`2`) and so on. These parts "
#~ "between each point are considered line segments. They have a length and the "
#~ "line can be said to have a direction based on the order of the points. "
#~ "Technically, a line is a single pair of coordinates connected together, "
#~ "whereas a line string is multiple lines connected together."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Polygons - When lines are strung together by more than two points, with the "
#~ "last point being at the same location as the first, we call this a polygon. "
#~ "A triangle, circle, rectangle, etc. are all polygons. The key feature of "
#~ "polygons is that there is a fixed area within them."

"100% page scale using the new Zoom to 100% tool on the toolbar. The composer"
" window now lets you quickly switch the page scaling via a new scale "
"combobox in the status bar. In addition, a new indicator has been added to "
"show you the precise pixel position of your cursor. The **\\[Close\\]** and "

"resizing to maintain an item's ratio while resizing, or hold :kbd:`Ctrl` to "
"resize from the item's centre. These shortcut keys also apply to moving "
"items, so holding :kbd:`Shift` while moving an item constrains the movement "

"you can output the current page without outputting the entire atlas. You can"
" also tweak the map extent or scale for each feature while previewing the "
"atlas page. Atlas map settings have been moved from the atlas panel to the "
"map properties panel, so now, more than one map can be controlled by the "
"atlas generation. There's a new option to automatically centre an overview "
"map, which comes in handy when creating atlas-based maps. More context "
"information is also now available so that you can adjust your symbology "
"based on whether the feature is the current atlas feature or not."

"to help you navigate your compositions. You can now zoom in or out from a "
"composition by using the mouse scroll wheel. A dedicated pan tool has been "
"added, which allows you to drag the composition around, and you can also "
"switch immediately to pan mode by holding the space bar or by holding the "
"mouse scroll wheel. There's also a new zoom tool, which allows you to "
"precisely zoom to a specific area of your composition. You can also switch "

"zoom region on the composition."

"transparent) background. Shape items (rectangles, triangles and ellipses) "
"can also be styled using the same options as polygon map layers. You can "

"The position of a coordinate in UTM south of the equator must be indicated "

"**easting (x) value** in meters. The **northing value** is the distance of "

"distance from the **central meridian** (longitude) of the used UTM zone. For"
" UTM zone 35S it is **27 degrees** **East** as shown in figure_utm_for_sa_. "
"Furthermore, because we are south of the equator and negative values are not"
" allowed in the UTM coordinate reference system, we have to add a so called "
"**false northing value** of 10,000,000 m to the northing (y) value and a "
